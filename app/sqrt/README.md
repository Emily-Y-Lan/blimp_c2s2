# sqrt

This code in particular bears sentimental value to the author (Aidan)
because it:

 - is the first low-level code he wrote (in ECE 2400, the first class
   he took with Prof. Batten)
 - is some of the first programming he did at Cornell (aside from CS 1110)
 - is the first time coding felt "cool", because of the tangible effects
   that hardware details (specifically bitwidths) had on the functionality
 - showcases the growth he's made in his time at Cornell (particularly
   his concision in commenting)

The code is left in an intentionally low-quality state, with minimal
changes from the original. Please do not modify
