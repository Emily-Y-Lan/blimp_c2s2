# Colossal Cave Adventure

This is the real, full-blown Colossal Cave Adventure game, written by Will Crowther and Don Woods at Stanford AI Lab in the early '70s. It is the first interactive fiction game where the computer simulates and describes a situation, and the user types in what to do next, in simple English.
